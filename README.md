Analysing  bank credit card data and predict which group of customers are more likely to get churned so that we can target them to provide better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction using MySQL

*age**
#26-40
we can observe that the churn rate is highest at the age of 40 and lowest at the ages of 67, 70, and 73, where there is no churn at all. The retention rate is highest at the ages of 67, 70, and 73, where all the customers are still retained, and lowest at the age of 40.

In general, we can observe that the churn rate increases as the customers get older from 26 to 40 and then decreases gradually as the customers get older from 40 to 67. On the other hand, we can observe that the retention rate decreases as the customers get older from 26 to 40 and then increases gradually as the customers get older from 40 to 67.

One possible explanation for this trend is that younger customers (aged 26-40) may be more likely to churn because they are more likely to switch to other providers or cancel their subscription due to changing circumstances, such as moving or changing jobs. As customers get older (aged 40-67), they may become more established in their current circumstances, and their loyalty to the provider may increase as a result.

It is important to note that these observations are based on the limited data provided and may not be representative of the entire population. Additionally, there may be other factors at play that could impact the churn and retention rates, such as the quality of the provider's services or changes in the market.

#60-75
This indicates that customers in this age group are more likely to churn and less likely to be retained compared to younger customers.

There could be several reasons why this trend occurs. One possible explanation is that older customers may have different needs and preferences than younger customers, which may not be met by the company's products or services. Older customers may also be more price-sensitive and less likely to spend money on non-essential items, which could lead to them canceling their subscriptions or not renewing their contracts.

Another factor could be changes in life circumstances, such as retirement or health issues, which may affect their ability or willingness to continue using the company's products or services. Additionally, older customers may be more likely to have experienced problems or issues with the company's products or services, which could contribute to their decision to churn.

It's important for the company to analyze these trends and identify potential reasons for the increase in churn and decrease in retention among older customers. By understanding the underlying factors, the company can take steps to improve its products and services and retain more customers in this age group.
