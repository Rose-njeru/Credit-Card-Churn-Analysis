## Data Cleaning
**Checking for misssing values**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM churncostomerseda.bankchurners
WHERE CLIENTNUM is NULL OR Attrition_Flag IS NULL OR Customer_Age IS NULL OR Gender IS NULL OR Dependent_count is NULL OR Education_Level IS NULL OR Marital_Status IS Null;
```
+ No missing values

**Unique Customers**
```sql
SELECT 
DISTINCT CLIENTNUM
FROM churncostomerseda.bankchurners;
```
+ There's a total of  unique 10127 customers

## Column Manipulation
**Transforming the Attrition flag column into 1 and 0 using  CASE statement**

```sql
SELECT 
COUNT(Attrition_FLag) AS existing_customer_count
FROM churncostomerseda.bankchurners
WHERE Attrition_Flag ='Existing Customer';
```
+ There are 8500 existing customers
```sql
SELECT 
COUNT(Attrition_Flag) AS churned_customer_count
FROM churncostomerseda.bankchurners
WHERE Attrition_Flag ='Attrited Customer';
```
+ There are 1627 churned customers

```sql
SELECT
Attrition_FLag,
CASE 
WHEN Attrition_FLag ='Attrited Customer' THEN 1 
ELSE 0 END AS attrited_customer
FROM churncostomerseda.bankchurners
GROUP BY Attrition_Flag;
```

```
UPDATE churncostomerseda.bankchurners
SET Attrition_Flag=CASE 
WHEN Attrition_FLag ='Attrited Customer' THEN 1 
ELSE 0 END;
```
```sql
SELECT 
Attrition_Flag
FROM churncostomerseda.bankchurners
GROUP BY Attrition_Flag;
```

**Customer Age**

```sql

**26-40**
+ The churn rate increases as the age of customers increases from 26 to 40, then decreases gradually as the customers get older, from 40 to 67. On the other hand, we can observe that the retention rate decreases as the customers get more senior, from 26 to 40, and then increases gradually as the customers get older, from 40 to 67.
+ One possible explanation for this trend is that younger customers (aged 26-40) may be more likely to churn because they are more likely to switch to other providers or cancel their subscriptions due to changing circumstances, such as moving or changing jobs. As customers get older (aged 40-67), they may become more established in their current affairs, and their loyalty to the provider may increase.
+ Additionally, other factors may be at play that could impact the churn and retention rates, such as the quality of the provider's services or changes in the market.

**60-70**
+ The churn rate gradually increases, and the retention rate gradually decreases as the customer ages 60 to 75. Indicating that customers in this age group are likelier to churn and less likely to be retained than younger customers.
+ There could be several reasons why this trend occurs. Older customers may have different needs and preferences than younger customers, which the company's products or services may need to meet. Older customers may also be more price-sensitive and less likely to spend money on non-essential items, which could lead to them canceling their subscriptions or not renewing their contracts.
+ Another factor could be changed in life circumstances, such as retirement or health issues, which may affect their ability or willingness to continue using the company's products or services. Additionally, older customers may be more likely to have experienced problems or issues with the company's products or services, which could contribute to their decision to churn

+ Customers with 3 depedents having the highest rate of 17.64% while lowest churn rate is for customers with 5 dependents (15.09%). 
+ However, the differences in churn rates between the different groups are relatively small. Overall, the churn rates for all the groups are fairly similar, ranging from 14.64% to 17.64%.

/* month inactive 12 months
The first row, with 0 months of inactivity, shows that 51.72% of the customers who were inactive for 0 months churned, while the remaining 48.28% were retained.

As the number of months of inactivity increased, the churn rate increased and the retention rate decreased. For example, when customers were inactive for 1 month, only 4.48% of them churned, while 95.52% were retained. However, when customers were inactive for 4 months, the churn rate was 29.89%, indicating that nearly one-third of the customers who were inactive for 4 months churned.

This trend suggests that customer engagement is an essential factor in retaining customers. As customers become less engaged and less active, they are more likely to churn. Therefore, it is crucial for companies to continuously engage and communicate with their customers to keep them satisfied and retain their business.*/

As the number of times the bank contacted the customer increases, the churn rate tends to increase as well. For example, customers who were contacted 5 times had a churn rate of 33.52%, which is higher than the churn rate of customers who were contacted only once (7.20%). This suggests that excessive contact with customers may lead to dissatisfaction and ultimately churn.

It is also interesting to note that customers who were contacted 6 times had a 100% churn rate, meaning that all of these customers left the bank. This could indicate that the bank may have over-contacted these customers or that there were underlying issues with the bank's products or services that led to such high churn rates.
